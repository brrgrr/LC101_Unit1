nums = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]

# TODO 1
# print each number on a new line
# your code here:

for i in nums:
    print(i)

# TODO 2
# print each number and its square on a new line
# so that each line reads, for example, like this: The square of 12 is 144
# your code here:

for j in nums:
    print("The square of", j, "is", (j**2))
