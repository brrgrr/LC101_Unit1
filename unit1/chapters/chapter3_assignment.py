#For each click variable, calculate the temperature and print it as shown in the instructions
## Generic code with input:
## clicks = int(input("How many clicks?"))
## current_temperature = (clicks % 50) + 40
## print("The temperature is", current_temperature)

click_1 = 0
# TODO calculate the temperature, and report it back to the user
current_temperature = (click_1 % 50) + 40
print("The temperature is", current_temperature)

click_2 = 49
# TODO calculate the temperature, and report it back to the user
current_temperature = (click_2 % 50) + 40
print("The temperature is", current_temperature)

click_3 = 74
# TODO calculate the temperature, and report it back to the user
current_temperature = (click_3 % 50) + 40
print("The temperature is", current_temperature)

click_4 = 51
# TODO calculate the temperature, and report it back to the user
current_temperature = (click_4 % 50) + 40
print("The temperature is", current_temperature)

click_5 = -1
# TODO calculate the temperature, and report it back to the user
current_temperature = (click_5 % 50) + 40
print("The temperature is", current_temperature)

click_6 = 200
# TODO calculate the temperature, and report it back to the user
current_temperature = (click_6 % 50) + 40
print("The temperature is", current_temperature)
